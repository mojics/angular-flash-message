Angular Flash Message

Angular Flash message supports displaying flash message on your AngularJS app. Currently we didn't include styling since you have to do it on your own.

## Install
`bower install angular-flash-message`

## Usage
After adding `angular-flash-directive.js` to your project, add `angular-flash` as a dependency to your module. Once Angular flash is included you can now access or showing messages using $flash factory. Here is a simple example:

```javascript
angular.module('yourModule', ['angular-flash'])
.controller('YourController', function($scope, $flash) {
  $scope.save = function() {
    // â€¦ save the product
    $flash({message: 'FLASH Message !!!', type: 'warning'});
  };
});
```

But you have to put first the Angular flash directive, insert this code snippet anywhere on your AngularJS App:


```javascript
<angular-flash></angular-flash>
```
